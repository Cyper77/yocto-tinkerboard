# yocto-tinkerboard

This is my first successful build for an Yocto image that enables the following on Asus Tinker board

*** VPU - Hardware accelerated decoding & encoding
*** Gstreamer support for VPU
*** Mali Kernel & user space libraries (OpenCL is the best)
*** WiFi 
*** Video processing libraries (FFMEPG, OpenCV etc.,)

Rockchip's yocto instructions are here http://rockchip.wikidot.com/yocto-user-guide and have been hugely helpful
Additionally, the Rockchip linux group have been very helpful https://github.com/rockchip-linux
